# A Late Fusion CNN for Digital Matting

-----

This is the github project for our paper __A Late Fusion CNN for Digital Matting__.

We provide the supplementary material of our paper here.

Sorry for the inconvience but due to Alibaba's policy we cannot share our human matting dataset currently.

## Code, Model & Clarification

You can download the code and model at https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuG441T6ysq5gytUc8LNhwv-MlqY?e=n0cpaU

**Please note: In our paper, we used two different datasets: DIM dataset and our human matting dataset.**

**The model we released is trained on DIM dataset's TRAIN split and finetuned on our human matting dataset's TRAIN split. We didn't train our model on DIM's TEST split. The state in Background Matting (arXiv: 2004.00626) Section 4.1: 'as the released model was trained on all of the Adobe data, including the test data used here (confirmed by the authors)' is not true.**

**We've already contacted the author of Background Matting for the correction in the corresponding section.**
