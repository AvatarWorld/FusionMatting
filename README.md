# A Late Fusion CNN for Digital Matting

-----

This is the github project for our paper __A Late Fusion CNN for Digital Matting__.

We provide the supplementary material of our paper here.

Sorry for the inconvience but due to Alibaba's policy we cannot share our human matting dataset anymore.

## Code, Model & Clarification

You can download the code and model at https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuG441T6ysq5g1GM17vPsk1VaJOY?e=F202T7

**Please note: the model we released is trained on both DIM and our human matting dataset's TRAIN split, not on DIM's TRAIN-TEST split.**

**We've contacted the author of Background Matting (arXiv: 2004.00626) for the correction in their result section.**

Please email us (yunkezhang@zju.edu.cn) if you have any question.
